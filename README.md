# raindrops

Project from 2014 when I was first learning JavaScript and playing with graphics and animations (SVG).

Try it yourself. Just open raindrops.htm in a browser. (If I recall correctly there is a memory leak, so be warned and don't leave it open for hours on end.)  :-)

A few screenshots:
